<h3><b>Note I have a bug in a publishing (works locally) Generals databse should not be empty, working on it.</b></h3>

        This is similar to my <a href="http://lyndonmackay.com/angular/#/about">angular website</a>. I have once again disabled editing for
        generals as allowing arbitrary text would make it possible for obscene material
        to be placed in the database.

        <b>This Website is work in progress.</b>
        This was made using visual studio 2017
        <b>C# ASP.net MVC, Entity Frameworks.</b>
